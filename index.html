        Income <= 2,50,000: No tax
        
        Income > 2,50,000 and <= 5,00,000: 5% of the amount exceeding 2,50,000
        
        Income > 5,00,000 and <= 10,00,000: 12,500 + 20% of the amount exceeding 5,00,000
        
        Income > 10,00,000: 1,12,500 + 30% of the amount exceeding 10,00,000
        
        Requirements:
        
        Input: A variable representing income
        
        Output: Total tax payable
        </p>
        <p>2.Shipping Cost Based on Weight and Destination

            Problem:
            Write a program that calculates the shipping cost for a parcel based on its weight and destination:
            
            Weight <= 1kg:
            
            Local: 5rs
            
            National: 8rs
            International: 15rs

Weight > 1kg and <= 5kg:

Local: 10rs

National: 15rs

International: 30rs

Weight > 5kg and <= 10kg:

Local: 20rs

National: 25rs

International: 50rs

Weight > 10kg:
Local: 30rs

National: 35rs

International: 70rs


Requirements:

Input: Two variables for weight and destination

Output: The total shipping cost

<p>3 Electricity Bill Calculation Based on Usage

    Problem:
    Write a program to calculate the electricity bill based on the number of units consumed:
    
    Units <= 100: 1rs per unit
    
    Units > 100 and <= 300: 1rs per unit for the first 100 units + 1.5rs per unit for the next 200 units
    
    Units > 300: 1rs per unit for the first 100 units + 1.5rs per unit for the next 200 units + 2rs per unit beyond 300
    
    Requirements:
    
    Input: A variable representing the number of units consumed
    
    Output: Total electricity bill amount
